# Class
# what is class
# In Python, a class serves as a blueprint or a template for creating objects.

# what is __init__ in class
# This is a special method known as the constructor.
# It is automatically called when a new instance of the class is created and is used to initialize the instance's attributes.

# what is self in class
# This parameter is a convention in Python methods and refers to the current instance of the class.
# It must be the first parameter of any method within a class.

# What is attribute in class
# These are variables associated with a class or its instances. They can be:
# Class Variables: Shared by all instances of the class.(val1 = "test")
# Instance Variables: Unique to each individual instance of the class.(self.name)

# 49) write a class to convert tuples in list
mytuples = [(1, 'a', 11), (2, 'b', 12), (3, 'c', 13), (4, 'd', 14)]

# NOTES IMPORTANT READ FIRST AND THEN CODE

# What is Inheritance
# Inheritance in Python is a fundamental concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
# that allows a new class (called the child class or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from
# an existing class (called the parent class or superclass).

# What is override in inheritance
# Override methods:
# Provide a new implementation for a method that is already defined in the parent class, effectively changing
# its behavior for instances of the child class.

# Code Reusability:
# Inheritance promotes code reusability by allowing child classes to utilize the functionalities already
# defined in the parent class, avoiding redundant code.

# What is super()
# The super() function is commonly used within the child class's __init__ method to call the parent class's constructor
# and initialize inherited attributes.

# How many inheritance are there in Python?
# The five types of inheritance in Python are single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical, and hybrid inheritance

# OVERLOADING IN PYTHON
# In many programming languages like C++ or Java, you can define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists.
# This concept is called method overloading.
# Python does not support method overloading by default. If you define multiple methods with the same name,
# only the latest definition will be used.
# however, it offers several techniques to simulate method overloading.
# Using Variable Arguments (*args)
# Using Default Arguments (None as default value)
# Using Multiple Dispatch
#  a) Python's multipledispatch library allows true method overloading by dispatching functions based on parameter types and counts.
#  b) Install multipledispatch module using the following command: pip install multipledispatch

# 50) Write a class first for two unequal list and inherit class for three unequal list (normal way)

# Multiple inheritance
# super() function does not able to call particular class in multiple inheritance
# instead we use the class name __init__ constructor for multiple inheritance
# for example
# person.__init__(self, name, age)
# teacher.__init__(self, teacher_name)

# MRO: Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order in which Python looks for a method in a hierarchy of classes.
# Especially it plays vital role in the context of multiple inheritance as single method may be found in multiple super classes.
# So if we have same method name in both the parent clasess, it perform MRO and take the method from the first class we have specified in inheritance class
# for example
# class Student(teacher, person): it will pick from teacher parent class
# class Student(person, teacher): it will pick from person parent class

# What is ENCAPSULATION

# Encapsulation means hiding internal details of a class and only exposing whatâ€™s necessary.
# It helps to protect important data from being changed directly and keeps the code secure and organized.
# Technically, encapsulation is an object-oriented programming principle where data (variables)
# and methods (functions) are bundled together in a class.
# By default in python all are public like instant variable, methods and properties of class
# any one can change the value of instant variable, by creating instance of class they can change the variables.
# for example
# obj1 = student()
# res = obj1.score = 89
# Access specifiers in python: 1) public  2) private(double underscore __) 3) protect(single underscore _)
# We can also use setter and getter functions for variables
# private can used only in only in class
# protector varibale can be used only and only in derived/sub/child inheritance class
# Note: protector variable are still accessible directly.
# Use a single underscore (_) before a method name to indicate it is protected meant to be used within class or its subclasses.
# Use a double underscore (__) to define a private method accessible only within class due to name mangling.
# Note: Unlike other programming languages, Python does not enforce access modifiers like public, private or protected at the language level.
# However, it follows naming conventions and uses a technique called name mangling to support encapsulation.

# 52) Write a class which use private variable, so they should not change the value directly

# abstract class
# what is ABSTRACT CLASS
# An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and serves as a blueprint for other classes(child clasess).

# What is Polymorphism in Python?
# The term polymorphism refers to a function or method taking different forms in different contexts.
# Since Python is a dynamically typed language, polymorphism in Python is very easily implemented.
# If a method in a parent class is overridden with different business logic in its different child classes,
# the base class method is a polymorphic method.

# Ways of implementing Polymorphism in Python
# There are four ways to implement polymorphism in Python âˆ’

# Duck Typing
# Operator Overloading
# Method Overriding
# Method Overloading

# Duck Typing
# Duck typing is a concept where the type or class of an object is less important than the methods it defines.
# Using this concept, you can call any method on an object without checking its type, as long as the method exists.
# This term is defined by a very famous quote that states: Suppose there is a bird that walks like a duck,
# swims like a duck, looks like a duck, and quaks like a duck then it probably is a duck.
# We can pass any class or method from function/method.

# 56 write a program for duck typing

class Duck:
    def sound(self):
        return "Quack Quack"

class Bird:
    def sound(self):
        return "I am Similar to Duck"

# Method Overriding in Python
# In method overriding, a method defined inside a subclass has the same name as a method in its superclass
# but implements a different functionality.

# 57 Write a program for Method Overriding

# Operators overloading
# Operator Overloading means giving extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning.
# For example operator + is used to add two integers as well as join two strings and merge two lists.
# It is achievable because '+' operator is overloaded by int class and str class.
# You might have noticed that the same built-in operator or function shows different behavior for objects of different classes,
# this is called Operator Overloading.
# + Operator perform addition of integer, same operator perform concatenation of string,
# * Operator perform multiplication of integer, same operator perform repeatation of word ("greek"*4)
# Note: __str__ Operator will return the values

# 58 Write a program for Operator Overloading

# Python does not allow overloading of methods by default, however,
# we can use the techniques like argument lists, multiple dispatch and default parameters to achieve this.
# For multiple dispatch we need to install pip install multipledispatch
# for example len() function/method will get len info for list, tuples, dictionary and strings, this is method overloading

# Decorators enable wrapping another function to extend or alter its behavior dynamically at runtime.

# 60 write the program for WRAPPER Function or Class

def div(a, b):
    print(a/b)

# Above the actually function/method, we dont want to alter its code to swap the values.
# Cos we have imported or inbuilt function.
# So we can write the decorators/wrappers to alert the function behaviuor in different function
# So we can function under function

# let's write the decorator function

def smart_div(func):
    def inner_func(a, b):
        if a < b:
            a, b = b, a
        return func(a, b)
    return inner_func

div = smart_div(div)
print(f"Question 60 DECORATOR/WRAPPER answer is : ")
div(2, 4)

# calling using decorator
@smart_div
def sub(a, b):
    print(a - b)

sub(2, 5)
